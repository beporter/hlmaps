DESCRIPTION
-----------
HLmaps is a Perl/CGI script for Linux and FreeBSD (and possibly NT) Half-Life
game server admins written by Scott McCrory.  It allows web site visitors to
view all your loaded maps, screen shots, download links and some file
statistics in a nice, sortable table.

HLmaps should be pretty safe to use, as I've implemented Perl's "warn" and
"taint" modes (although NT ActiveState Perl users may need to remove the -T).
Processing loads won't be very noticable if only a few people use it at a time
but under more use HLmaps would do a lot of directory scanning and logfile
parsing, so keep that in mind if you have a really busy web site (in the future
I may provide MySQL support to fix this problem).

REQUIRES
--------
  Linux or FreeBSD (and possibly NT)
  Perl 5.0+ (Ships with nearly every *nix distribution)
  Apache web server	http://www.apache.org (others supporting CGI may work)
  Half-Life Server software (well duh!)

DOWNLOADING
-----------
Home page:
      http://hlmaps.sourceforge.net

INSTALLING
----------
Please read the INSTALL file in this package for installation and upgrade info.

CONTRIBUTING
------------
If you're interested in contributing to HLmaps, by all means study this
package and check out the home page at http://hlmaps.sourceforge.net where
you'll find a link to the CVS tree, developer mailing lists, etc.  I sure
could use help with everything from bug fixes to additional map images to
additional platform ports to documentation to optimizing code to
adding features...!

Hope you enjoy!
Scott and the HLmaps development team.

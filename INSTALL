INSTALLING
----------
First install all of the JPG images from the hlmaps_images package into a
web-accessable directory.  If you already (or plan to) use the hlds_ld.cgi or
hlstat.pl scripts then make all of them point to the same directory to make it
better to maintain.

The configuration part is a little more cumbersome than it will be in the
next version, which will use a separate /etc/hlmaps.conf file.  But for now
you need to edit the hlmaps.pl script and change the GLOBAL CONSTANTS section
to match your installation.

Then copy the hlmaps.pl script into your web server's cgi directory
(usually /home/httpd/cgi-bin/) and assign it the same owner and group
assignments and file permissions that you usually use for your other CGI
scripts.  For example, I run my Apache daemon under an "httpd" user and an
"httpd" group.  So I do the following:

cp hlmaps.pl /home/httpd/cgi-bin/
chown httpd.httpd /home/httpd/cgi-bin/hlmaps.pl
chmod 555 /home/httpd/cgi-bin/hlmaps.pl

Now fire up a browser and test the script by going to
http://my.server.com/cgi-bin/hlmaps.pl and see if you get output.  If the images
don't show up, then check the GLOBAL CONSTANTS settings.  If it doesn't find
maps, then check the GLOBAL CONSTANTS settings.  If it doesn't detect mapcycle
inclusion, then check the GLOBAL CONSTANTS settings.  Get it? :-)

Let me know if you have problems AFTER you've checked things over several times
and please be specific about what you see and what you've tried.  Im VERY
interested in making this work on all variants of Linux and possibly NT/2000,
so please also let me know about your successes!

Hope you enjoy!
Scott and the HLmaps development team.

Install Images
--------------
First install all of the JPG images from the hlmaps_images package into a
web-accessable directory.  If you already (or plan to) use hlds_ld.cgi
(available at http://linuxhlds.halflife.org/) or hlmon.pl (available at
http://www.linuxquake.com/qsmon) then make all of them point to the same
directory to make it simpler to maintain.

Modify and Copy Preferences
---------------------------
If this is a new installation, edit the hlmaps.conf.distrib file that came
with the distribution to point to the paths and use the appearances you want.
Then copy it somewhere like your /etc/ directory and assign appropriate owner,
group and file permissions so that your web server can read it.  For example,
I run my Linux Apache daemon under an "httpd" user and an "httpd" group.  So
I'd do the following:

   cp hlmaps.conf.distrib /etc/hlmaps.conf
   chown httpd.httpd /etc/hlmaps.conf
   chmod 444 /etc/hlmaps.conf

NOTE to NT users: This script works with ActiveState's Perl for NT if
   you take out the "-T" on the first line of the script.  Just make sure that
   your paths in the .conf file, as well as in the beginning of the hlmaps.pl
   script are correct.

If you're simply upgrading the script, you may not have to do the above
depending on if there are any new variables that you should have in your .conf
file.  !! Check the CHANGELOG and compare your .conf with the distrib copy to
make sure !!

Copy the Actual Script
----------------------
Finally copy the hlmaps.pl script into your web server's cgi directory
(usually /home/httpd/cgi-bin/) and assign it the same owner and group
assignments and file permissions that you usually use for your other CGI
scripts.  For example, I run my Linux Apache daemon under an "httpd" user and
an "httpd" group.  So I'd do the following:

   cp hlmaps.pl /home/httpd/cgi-bin/
   chown httpd.httpd /home/httpd/cgi-bin/hlmaps.pl
   chmod 555 /home/httpd/cgi-bin/hlmaps.pl

Test and Troubleshoot
---------------------
Now fire up a browser and test the script by going to
http://my.server.com/cgi-bin/hlmaps.pl and see if you get output.  If the images
don't show up, then check the IMAGES_DIR and IMAGES_URL settings.  If it doesn't
find maps, then check the SERVER_xxxx_DIR settings.  If it doesn't detect mapcycle
inclusion, then check the MAPCYCLE setting.  Again, make sure your permissions
are correct and also check to make sure that you don't have a funky mapcycle.txt
file, etc. which may have extra characters inside.  I've heard of several people
fixing mapcycle detection by re-creating the file using vi from scratch.

Let me know if you have problems AFTER you've checked things over several times
and please be specific about what you see and what you've tried.

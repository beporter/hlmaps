Install Images
--------------
First install all of the JPG images from the hlmaps_images package into a
web-accessable directory.  If you already (or plan to) use hlds_ld.cgi
(available at http://linuxhlds.halflife.org/) or hlmon.pl (available at
http://www.linuxquake.com/qsmon) then make all of them point to the same
directory to make it simpler to maintain.

Modify and Copy Preferences
---------------------------
If this is a new installation, edit the hlmaps.conf.distrib file that came
with the distribution to point to the paths and use the appearances you want.
Then copy it to your /etc/ directory and assign appropriate owner, group and
file permissions so that your web server can read it.  For example, I run my
Apache daemon under an "httpd" user and an "httpd" group.  So I'd do the
following:

   cp hlmaps.conf.distrib /etc/hlmaps.conf
   chown httpd.httpd /etc/hlmaps.conf
   chmod 444 /etc/hlmaps.conf

NOTE to NT testers: This script _may_ work with ActiveState's Perl for NT if
you take out the "-T" on the first line of the script.

If you're simply upgrading the script, you probably don't have to do the above
depending on if there are any new variables you should have in your .conf
file.  Check the CHANGELOG and compare your .conf with the distrib copy to
make sure

Copy the Actual Script
----------------------
Finally copy the hlmaps.pl script into your web server's cgi directory
(usually /home/httpd/cgi-bin/) and assign it the same owner and group
assignments and file permissions that you usually use for your other CGI
scripts.  For example, I run my Apache daemon under an "httpd" user and an
"httpd" group.  So I'd do the following:

   cp hlmaps.pl /home/httpd/cgi-bin/
   chown httpd.httpd /home/httpd/cgi-bin/hlmaps.pl
   chmod 555 /home/httpd/cgi-bin/hlmaps.pl

Test and Troubleshoot
---------------------
Now fire up a browser and test the script by going to
http://my.server.com/cgi-bin/hlmaps.pl and see if you get output.  If the images
don't show up, then check the IMAGES_DIR and IMAGES_URL settings.  If it doesn't
find maps, then check the SERVER_xxxx_DIR settings.  If it doesn't detect mapcycle
inclusion, then check the MAPCYCLE setting.  Get it? :-)

Let me know if you have problems AFTER you've checked things over several times
and please be specific about what you see and what you've tried.  Im VERY
interested in making this work on all variants of Linux and possibly NT/2000,
so please also let me know about your successes!

Hope you enjoy!

             Some important things have changed since 0.93, so
    READ THIS WHOLE FILE    READ THIS WHOLE FILE    READ THIS WHOLE FILE
                      There, you've been told! :-)

Install Images
--------------
First install all of the JPG images from the hlmaps_images package available
at http://sourceforge.net/project/filelist.php?group_id=8280 into a
web-accessable directory.  If you already (or plan to) use hlds_ld.cgi
(available at http://linuxhlds.halflife.org/) or hlmon.pl (available at
http://www.linuxquake.com/qsmon) then make all of them point to the same
directory to make all simpler to maintain.

Modify and Copy Preferences
---------------------------
NOTE to NT users: Make sure that your paths in the .conf file, as well as in
the beginning of the hlmaps.pl and hlmaps.cron scripts are correct and use "\"
characters instead of "/" for DIR paths.
   
Edit the hlmaps.conf.distrib file that came with the distribution to point to
the paths and use the appearances you want.  Then copy it somewhere like your
/etc/ directory as hlmaps.conf and assign appropriate owner, group and file
permissions so that your web server can read it.  For example, I run my Linux
Apache daemon under an "httpd" user and an "httpd" group.  So I'd do the
following:

   cp hlmaps.conf.distrib /etc/hlmaps.conf
   chown httpd.httpd /etc/hlmaps.conf
   chmod 444 /etc/hlmaps.conf

Set Up The Cron Script
----------------------
HLmaps now uses a cron script (hlmaps.cron) to periodically collect info
from the map directory, download dir, mapcycle, server logs, etc.  This makes
HLmaps MUCH lighter on the server by not having to parse all those things
for each web hit!  However, it means you have to take 2 additional steps over
version 0.93 - 1) set up the cron job and 2) make sure the data file has the
right permissions for read and write.  If you're running Linux, this is very
easy.  Simply copy hlmaps.cron to the /etc/cron.daily directory and make it
executable by typing:

   cp hlmaps.cron /etc/cron.daily/hlmaps.cron
   chown root.root /etc/cron.daily/hlmaps.cron
   chmod 755 /etc/cron.daily/hlmaps.cron
   
You should make sure that it's pointing to the hlmaps.conf file above and then
test it by invoking it from the command line:

    /etc/cron.daily/hlmaps.cron
    
If it doesn't say anything to you, then it most likely worked - check for
/var/hlmaps.data (or whatever your specified) for content.  You're already
half-way there!

Set up Data File Permissions
----------------------------
As mentioned in the section above, you'll now need to make sure the hlmaps.pl
(run by the web server) can be read correctly.  I recommend:

    chmod 744 /var/hlmaps.data

Copy the Perl/CGI Script
------------------------
NOTE to NT users: This script works with ActiveState's Perl for NT if
you take out the "-T" on the first line of the hlmaps.pl script.

Finally copy the hlmaps.pl script into your web server's cgi directory
(usually /home/httpd/cgi-bin/) and assign it the same owner and group
assignments and file permissions that you usually use for your other CGI
scripts.  For example, I run my Linux Apache daemon under an "httpd" user and
an "httpd" group.  So I'd do the following:

   cp hlmaps.pl /home/httpd/cgi-bin/
   chown httpd.httpd /home/httpd/cgi-bin/hlmaps.pl
   chmod 555 /home/httpd/cgi-bin/hlmaps.pl

Test and Troubleshoot
---------------------
Now fire up a browser and test the script by going to
http://my.server.com/cgi-bin/hlmaps.pl and see if you get output.  If the images
don't show up, then check the IMAGES_DIR and IMAGES_URL settings.  If it doesn't
find maps, then check the SERVER_xxxx_DIR settings.  If it doesn't detect mapcycle
inclusion, then check the MAPCYCLE setting.  Again, make sure your permissions
are correct and also check to make sure that you don't have a funky mapcycle.txt
file which may have extra characters inside.  I've heard of several people
fixing mapcycle detection by re-creating the file from scratch using vi.

Let me know if you have problems AFTER you've checked things over several times
and please be specific about what you see and what you've tried.

MySQL Notes
-----------
MySQL is not supported yet, but I'm very close to implementing it.  Because of
that, you'll see some "prestigial" variables in the .conf file that don't do
anything.  If you're interested in MySQL capabilities, please email me, as I
need some beta testers...

Hope you enjoy!

---------------------------------------------
- bugfix, + enhancement, * contrib, = RELEASE
---------------------------------------------

= 0.93 07/25/2000
  * Thanks to Martin Hömberg for many ideas behind this release!
  + Confirmed NT portability - admins will just have to remove the "-T" on the
    script's "shebang" line to make it work under ActiveState Perl.  Martin
    gets big kudos for testing and offering solutions for this.
  + Internationalized HLmaps output - use the .conf file to make it print the
    output in your language.
  + Map image now links to the download package if one exists.
  + Added .conf option for different download extension in case you make your
    maps downloads available in .arj, .arc, .gz, etc.
  + Added color to table header row to indicate current sort order.
  + Added indication of what position a map is in the mapcycle.
  + Added ability to specify number of maps per page displayed, as well as the
    paging navigation bar.  This should be great for servers with tons of
    maps and 56k modem clients who don't want to wait for pages to load.

= 0.92 07/22/2000
  - Fixed problem where a DOS-edited mapcycle with carriage returns would
    prevent HLmaps from understanding it correctly.  Should work fine now.
  - Now only using Perl-internal dir and file access functions instead of the
    kludgy "ls" that I was using.  Should make porting to NT easier.
  + HLmaps now uses a separate /etc/hlmaps.conf file for more flexible editing
    of preferences and easier script upgrades.  Note that users running mult-
    iple instances of HLmaps on the same system will want to edit the script's
    $CONF_FILE variables to point to seperate hlmaps.conf files.
  + The INSTALL file was updated with the new procedures now that we have a
    separate hlmaps.conf file.
  + User can now sort by map modification date/time.
  + Imported project into SourceForge's CVS repository.
  + Again tested OK with Apache/mod_perl's "PerlRun" compatability mode.
    This is now part of my standard testing procedures and is probably as far
    as I'll ever get to true mod_perl unless someone want to help.

= 0.91 07/21/2000
  - Fixed problem where cat | grep could only handle up to 1500 line files
    by using Perl internal file access -- Glen Muras.
  + Tested OK with Apache/mod_perl's "PerlRun" compatability mode.

= 0.90 07/20/2000 -- Scott (smccrory@users.syshealth.net)
  First public release.

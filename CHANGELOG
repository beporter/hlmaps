---------------------------------------------
- bugfix, + enhancement, * contrib, = RELEASE
---------------------------------------------

= 0.92 07/22/2000
  - Fixed problem where a DOS-edited mapcycle with carriage returns would
    prevent HLmaps from understanding it correctly.  Should work fine now.
  - Now only using Perl-internal dir and file access functions instead of the
    kludgy "ls" that I was using.  Should make porting to NT easier.
  + HLmaps now uses a separate /etc/hlmaps.conf file for more flexible editing
    of preferences and easier script upgrades.  Note that users running mult-
    iple instances of HLmaps on the same system will want to edit the script's
    $CONF_FILE variables to point to seperate hlmaps.conf files.
  + The INSTALL file was updated with the new procedures now that we have a
    separate hlmaps.conf file.
  + User can now sort by map modification date/time.
  + Imported project into SourceForge's CVS repository.
  + Again tested OK with Apache/mod_perl's "PerlRun" compatability mode.
    This is now part of my standard testing procedures and is probably as far
    as I'll ever get to true mod_perl unless someone want to help.

= 0.91 07/21/2000
  - Fixed problem where cat | grep could only handle up to 1500 line files
    by using Perl internal file access -- Glen Muras.
  + Tested OK with Apache/mod_perl's "PerlRun" compatability mode.

= 0.90 07/20/2000 -- Scott (smccrory@users.syshealth.net)
  First public release.

IMAGE CONTRIBUTIONS
-------------------
    Probably the one thing I need the most help with is map images.  I'll never
have time to keep up with all the new maps for all the Half-Life mods out there
and so I really could use your help.  Please note that hlmon.pl, hlds_ld.cgi
and csserverstats script users will also benefit from your contributions, so
you're killing four birds with one stone!
    To contribute map images, just take a good screen shot (F5 key for most
people) at one of the most prominent (usually outdoor) place in the map.  Then,
look in your half-life directory for a .BMP file and if necessary brighten it
and increase the contrast, then change the image size to 212x160 and finally
sharpen the image a bit.  Save it to "mapname.jpg" and send it to me via email
at smccrory@users.sourceforge.net (please zip up a batch if you have more than
a few).  Also, please make the image quality as good as can be reasonably
expected to make it easy for visitors to identify a map by sight without going
blind.  If you don't want the hassle of tidying up the images but are still
willing to grab map shots, then just let me know and we'll split up the job.

CODE CONTRIBUTIONS
------------------
    If you just want to make suggestions about future versions of HLmaps, then
please use the surveys at the project home page (see above).  On the other
hand, I'm always appreciative of coding help since I'm still relatively new
at Perl.  Take a look through the code and talk to me about your intentions
and if there's a fit, I'll add you to the developer list and you'll be able
to use the CVS tree and other project tools!
